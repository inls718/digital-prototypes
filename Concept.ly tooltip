Some Concept.ly-specific quirks:
*Tooltips work best if you mouse over them from right-to-left.
**In order to see the details box that appears when a user has entered in a specific frequency value (rather than just hovering over it),
you need to click on the "text box" where the user would enter in the numbers. Ideally, this would be a text box where you could
enter in some numbers, but Concept.ly does not seem to support this kind of function.
